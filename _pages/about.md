I'm a PhD Student at the Linguistic Department at Georgetown University.
I am most interested in natural language understanding and how LLMs and computational systems encode linguistic structure
to perform complex NLU tasks. I am also interested in language modeling beyond text,
LLMs as models of cognition,
and treebanking.

Before coming to Georgetown, I was NLP engineer at NCSOFT, where I worked on NLU and information extraction.

Outside of classes and assitantships, I like to participate in intramural sports as both player and coach, 
attend free food events around campus,
and catch Thursday afternoon flights to Toronto.

For Summer 2025, I will be joining the [Lee Language Lab](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ealee/public/)
(University of Toronto, Ontario Tech University) as a visiting researcher.
