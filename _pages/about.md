I'm a PhD Student at the Linguistic Department at Georgetown University.
My interests include robust representations of language, how humans and statistical learners generalize to 
novel input, and language modeling beyond text prediction.

Before coming to Georgetown, I was NLP engineer at NCSOFT, where I worked on NLU and information extraction.

Outside of classes and assitantships, I like to participate in intramural sports as both player and coach,
and attend free food events around campus.
