I'm a PhD Student at the Linguistic Department at Georgetown University,
advised by [Ethan Wilcox](https://wilcoxeg.github.io/).
I am most interested in natural language understanding and how humans and computational systems 
interact with meaning and form when they process language and perform linguistic tasks.

Before coming to Georgetown, I was NLP engineer at NCSOFT, where I worked on NLU and information extraction.

Outside of classes and assitantships, I like to participate in intramural sports as both player and coach and
attend free food events around campus.

For Summer 2025, I will be joining the [Lee Language Lab](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ealee/public/)
(University of Toronto, Ontario Tech University) as a visiting researcher.
